## 📋 Improvement Suggestions

### Specific Recommendations
- Add unit tests for tools/knowledge_management.py functions
- Consider implementing tool autodiscovery for better server organization
- Create systematic validation for all refactored components

---

## 📊 Key Learnings & Action Items

### What Went Well
- **Clean separation**: Tools logic properly encapsulated in separate module
- **Server simplification**: Delegation pattern maintains clean server.py
- **Backward compatibility**: All functionality preserved during refactoring

### What Could Be Improved
- **Error handling**: Could add more specific error types for tool failures
- **Documentation**: Tool module needs comprehensive docstrings

### Action Items
- Validate process-retrospective with refactored version
- Create unit tests for knowledge management tools
- Document refactoring pattern for future tool additions
