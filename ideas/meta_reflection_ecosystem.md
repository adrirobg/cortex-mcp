### **Workflow Stages Detailed**

#### **Stage 1: Implementation Completion**
- Phase implementation completed (e.g., Phase 2.1: analyze_project)
- All deliverables validated and tested
- Ready for systematic analysis

#### **Stage 2: Meta-Reflection Trigger**
- **Manual**: `/project:retrospective phase-2.1`
- **Automated**: Post-completion hooks (future enhancement)
- **Contextual**: Specific focus areas (workflow, performance, architecture)

#### **Stage 3: Structured Analysis**
Using proven 5-Action methodology:
1. **Process Efficiency Analysis**: Plan vs reality comparison
2. **Code and Architecture Analysis**: Principle adherence review
3. **Bottlenecks and Friction Analysis**: Time distribution and friction points
4. **Improvement Suggestions**: Actionable enhancement recommendations
5. **Synthesis and Integration**: Knowledge capture + ideas repository update

#### **Stage 4: Ideas Capture and Categorization**
- Auto-update `ideas/future_improvements.json` with new insights
- Structured categorization: performance, architecture, workflow, tools, meta
- Priority scoring based on effort vs impact assessment
- Traceability linking ideas to specific experiences/phases

#### **Stage 5: Strategic Planning Integration**
- Select high-impact improvement idea from repository
- Feed to strategy-architect: `"Plan implementation of: [improvement.title]"`
- Generate comprehensive implementation plan using existing workflow
- Transform meta-insight into actionable roadmap

#### **Stage 6: Enhanced Implementation**
- Execute improvement plan using enhanced process
- Validation of improvements through measurable outcomes
- Documentation of changes and benefits realized

#### **Stage 7: Ecosystem Evolution**
- Next phase benefits from all accumulated improvements
- Compound improvement effect: each iteration gets better
- Institutional learning embedded in workflow
