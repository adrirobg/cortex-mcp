## ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications

### **Agent Profile Assignment Strategy**

**Intelligence Rules**:
- Tasks with `agent_profile` field populated use specified profile
- Fallback assignment based on task complexity, domain, and artifacts
- Load balancing across available agent profiles
- Specialization preference (security tasks â†’ security_engineer)

**Agent Profile Categories**:
```json
{
  "system_architect": {
    "specializations": ["architecture", "design", "system_integration"],
    "complexity_range": [3, 5],
    "max_concurrent_tasks": 2
  },
  "backend_developer": {
    "specializations": ["api", "database", "business_logic"],
    "complexity_range": [2, 4], 
    "max_concurrent_tasks": 3
  },
  "frontend_developer": {
    "specializations": ["ui", "components", "user_experience"],
    "complexity_range": [2, 4],
    "max_concurrent_tasks": 3
  }
}
```

**Resource Assignment Algorithm**:
- Priority 1: Exact specialization match
- Priority 2: Complexity range compatibility
- Priority 3: Current workload balancing
- Priority 4: Cross-training opportunities

### **Parallel Execution Optimization**

**Group Creation Strategy**:
```python
# Example parallel groups structure
parallel_groups = {
    "group_1": {
        "tasks": ["design_architecture_design", "design_data_model"],
        "agent_assignments": {
            "design_architecture_design": "system_architect_1",
            "design_data_model": "database_architect_1"
        },
        "estimated_duration": "2 days",
        "dependency_level": 0
    }
}
```

**Optimization Criteria**:
- Maximize parallel execution within resource constraints
- Minimize agent context switching between task types
- Balance workload across available resources
- Respect agent specialization preferences
